# Reqs

## Start Express JS API
- `git init` (git setup, but need to `git remote add` to connect to repo)
- `npm init -y` (create package.json, -y answers all questions)
- `npx gitignore node` (ignore node_modules folder)
- `npm i express helmet sqlite3` : express, helmet, sqlite3
- `npm i nodemon -D` : nodemon as dev dep

# Migrations
### A way to record changes to a database schema
**Like Git, for the database structure. Basically just commits.**

**EVERY CHANGE TO DATABASE SCHEMA (STRUCTURE) MUST BE DONE WITH A NEW MIGRATION (COMMIT)**

- Initialize knex for our project (creates `knexfile.js`): `knex init` 

- Optionally install knex globally on system: `npm i -g knex`. If installed globally, no longer need `npx`

- Create a migration: `npx knex migrate: make namehere`

- Use the migration to declare changes we plan to make to the schema: 

- Run a migration: `knex migrate:up`

- Go back/undo last migration. `knex migrate:down`

- Update database to latest changes/migrations: `knex migrate:latest` <= multiple new migrations

- Undo multiple migrations that ran together: `knex migrate:rollback`

Need to connect/configure our application so that it knows how to connect to database.
